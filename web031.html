        <div data-layer="ca18f96c-9c8f-4233-a4fb-31a9b93fe1f7" class="text02">In preparation for the new live-action Ghost in the Shell movie, I recently returned to the 1995 anime film on which it’s based, and I couldn’t help but think of two things: The Matrix, and philosopher Daniel Dennett.<br /><br />The link to The Matrix is obvious enough. Before making that movie, the Wachowskis showed Ghost in the Shell to producer Joel Silver as an example of what they wanted to accomplish with their non-animated action sequences. It’s not an adaptation, but The Matrix ended up borrowing heavily from both the structure and visuals of Ghost in the Shell.<br /><br />As for Dennett, the movie dwells on many of the same questions and ideas about the nature of consciousness with which Dennett, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at Tufts University, has spent the better part of his career engaging. As a recent New Yorker profile of Dennett notes, he believes that consciousness is “something like the product of multiple, layered computer programs running on the hardware of the brain.” It’s an evolutionary process, purely physical in nature, in which sensory information and other biological functions combine and grow correspondingly more complex over time. There’s no mystery‑just complexity.</div>
        <div data-layer="46cdadb4-d0b0-4071-8f0c-676dd7d5e027" class="text03">The anime Ghost in the Shell finishes with a protracted shootout against giant <br />robot tank that looks like a spider‑but the true climax is a lengthy monologue <br />in which the villain, a sentient computer program, explains how he <br />unexpectedly gained self-awareness, and laments the lack of basic life systems <br />like death and reproduction. He finishes the speech by asking the movie’s <br />protagonist, the cybernetically enhanced security officer Major Kusanagi, to <br />merge with him, allowing for an evolutionary procreation. It’s a Dennett-esque <br />foray into both the emergence of the self and its evolutionary perpetuation.<br /><br />These are the sorts of consciousness-expanding questions that have animated <br />the Ghost in the Shell franchise for more than two decades. The world of Ghost <br />in the Shell is part futuristic action movie and part philosophy lecture, in <br />which artfully constructed animated action sequences serve as vehicles for <br />investigations into the nature of consciousness. It’s a showcase for what top-<br />notch animation can do-one that the new movie never quite manages to match.</div>
